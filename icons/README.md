# Icon Files Needed

This directory should contain the following PNG icon files for the Chrome extension:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons should represent the extension (e.g., a combination of GitHub and Confluence logos, or arrows showing data flow).

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generators. The icons should be:

- Clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Consistent design across all sizes
- PNG format with transparent background
- Professional looking

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons or simple colored squares until proper icons are designed.
